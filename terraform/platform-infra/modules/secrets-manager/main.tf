# Force-delete any same-named secret that is pending deletion.
# Secrets Manager holds deleted secrets for up to 30 days by default.
# Without this, terraform apply fails with InvalidRequestException when
# re-applying after a destroy if the previous deletion used a recovery window.

# Force-delete-on-recreate workaround removed.
#
# Previously this used a terraform_data + local-exec provisioner that shelled
# out to the `aws` CLI directly. That re-introduces the exact hidden runtime
# dependency this codebase explicitly engineered around elsewhere — see the
# comment on the aws-auth ConfigMap in env/dev/main.tf, which documents why
# local-exec was removed from there ("broke on clean CI runners").
#
# It's also unnecessary going forward: aws_secretsmanager_secret.this below
# sets recovery_window_in_days = 0, so AWS deletes the secret immediately
# (no recovery window) whenever Terraform destroys it. There is nothing left
# in a "pending deletion" state for a future apply to collide with.
#
# If you're migrating an existing secret that was deleted under an OLDER
# version of this module (recovery window > 0) and you hit
# InvalidRequestException on apply, that's a one-time cleanup — run:
#   aws secretsmanager delete-secret --secret-id "<secret-name>" \
#     --force-delete-without-recovery --region "<region>"
# once, by hand, and the routine case above prevents it from recurring.
