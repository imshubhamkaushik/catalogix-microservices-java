    Run ansible-playbook scoped to one or more host groups via --limit.
 
    WHY TWO SEPARATE SUBPROCESSES (and not a single playbook run):
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Ansible loads ALL variables — including vault secrets — exactly once, at
    process startup, before any task executes.
 
    The problem:
      Phase 1 (common + sonarqube) generates vault_sonar_token and writes it
      into vault.yaml on disk. If Jenkins ran in the same ansible-playbook
      process, vault_sonar_token was already resolved to "" at startup.
      Ansible has no mechanism to retroactively fix a variable that was already
      resolved into a play's variable scope at parse time.
 
    The fix:
      Phase 1 and Phase 2 are SEPARATE subprocesses. subprocess.run() blocks
      until the first ansible-playbook exits completely. When Phase 2 starts,
      it is a brand-new OS process that reads vault.yaml fresh from disk —
      vault_sonar_token is already populated, so Jenkins renders
      /etc/default/jenkins with a real SONARQUBE_TOKEN value.
 
    WHY NOT THREE SUBPROCESSES (all / sonarqube / jenkins separately):
      The variable propagation problem only exists at the boundary where
      SonarQube writes vault_sonar_token and Jenkins reads it. There is no
      secret dependency between the 'all' play and the 'sonarqube' play —
      they can safely run in the same subprocess. Splitting 'all' into its
      own call adds a subprocess with no benefit.
 
    Args:
        limit:       Ansible --limit value. Comma-separated groups are valid,
                     e.g. "all,sonarqube" or "jenkins".
                     Must match group names defined in aws_ec2.yaml.

        - 'docker' role       : Docker CE, user group membership (jenkins host)
