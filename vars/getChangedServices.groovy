// jenkins/shared-library/vars/getChangedServices.groovy
//
// Returns the subset of `services` whose source changed since the last commit that
// this job BUILT SUCCESSFULLY. Used to skip the expensive test stage for services
// no one touched — NOT used to skip Docker build/scan/push (see Jenkinsfile
// header comment on why every image still gets built+pushed every run).
//
// Baseline = env.GIT_PREVIOUS_SUCCESSFUL_COMMIT (set by the Jenkins Git plugin).
// This used to be `HEAD~1`, which only ever looked at the LAST commit of a push:
//   * push of 3 commits touching user-svc, cart-svc, checkout-svc  -> only
//     checkout-svc was tested; the other two shipped untested
//   * a parent-pom.xml bump in commit 1 of a push was invisible to the
//     "shared file changed" safety net if commit 2 didn't touch it
//   * a build that FAILED left its changes "already seen", so the next build
//     (from a different service's fix) skipped the still-broken service
// Diffing against the last successful build fixes all three: anything not yet
// verified by a green run is re-tested.
//
// Fails SAFE: with no usable baseline (first build on a branch, baseline missing
// from this clone because of a shallow fetch / force-push / gc, or a malformed
// value) every service is treated as changed.
//
// Safety net: if the parent pom.xml, any Jenkinsfile, shared-library code under vars/,
// or the Helm chart changed anywhere in the range, every service is treated as changed.
// Shared build logic can affect all modules even when their own source did not move.
//
// Usage:
//   def changed = getChangedServices(BACKEND_SERVICES, [prefix: 'backend/'])
//   def changedFrontend = getChangedServices(['frontend-svc'], [prefix: ''])
// Optional: [baseCommit: '<sha>'] overrides the baseline (used by tests).
//
// Tests: groovy vars/test/GetChangedServicesTest.groovy
