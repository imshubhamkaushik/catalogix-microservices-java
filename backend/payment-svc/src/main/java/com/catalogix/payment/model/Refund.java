/**
 * A refund against a previously-successful CARD/UPI payment. Kept as its
 * own table rather than another row in payments — a refund isn't a payment
 * attempt, it's a reversal of one, and giving it its own shape avoids
 * overloading Payment.status with a meaning ("this row is money coming
 * back, not going out") the rest of that entity was never designed to carry.
 *
 * COD orders never reach here: see checkout-svc's ReturnSvc, which skips
 * calling this endpoint entirely for a COD order (nothing was ever
 * captured, so there's nothing to reverse).
